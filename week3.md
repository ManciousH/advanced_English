# WEEK3 HOMEWORK
1. >  To wrap up your points on the pro and con sides of the topic and share it on your E-portfolio
   
    It is a ever-lasting topic we faced with.
    On the pro sides:
    We encourage the openness of the school to the public, benefiting whether on the aspect of the school or students itself. As it had been discussed on the class, we talked a lot on the edge of opening the campus to the public: 
    1. reputation: As universities assume certain social expectations, they have to take the responsibility of showing what their campus life likes to others, meeting social order and appealing to the younger generation.
    2. attention: Opening to the public catches more eyes, home and abroad, in which case expending school's renown. With more attention gains more support and fund, creating a better condition for students pursuing their work, academical research or organizing club.
    3. government policy: TRUE lol.
   But what i wanna talk about is: How do we define the word 'open'? Most of us came to stage justing illustrating their point of view, which may not bolster to a deeper discussion. So I decide to further the discussion more specifically on the definition of 'open' because it differs base on everyone's standard. 
   So, if we regard the campus allowing everyone to visit without restriction as 'open', then true there will cause a lot unexpected incidents and safety concern. But should it be blame for the imperfect legislation of the university, or the uneducated of the certain people?
   well if we narrow down the word 'open' to a system with appointment, then we may to some extent solve the problem of safety and congestion of foot traffic. However, we may also limit the accessibility and inclusion of the campus. By requiring appointments or passes, we create barriers for certain groups of people who may not have the resources or knowledge to make appointments.
   Another aspect to consider is the purpose of opening the campus to the public. Is it primarily for promotional purposes or for educational engagement? If it is for promotion, then limited access with appointments might be sufficient. However, if the goal is to foster educational engagement and community outreach, a more inclusive approach should be taken.
