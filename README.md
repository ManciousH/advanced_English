## WHY USING GITHUB?
- as a student majoring in Electrial and Computer Engineering, learn how to use github is a living skill lol. So i decided to use it as my e-profolio to submit my english homework written by *markdown*  ,as well as getting known to use this platform.
- thx for Mrs. Ma's understanding and I bet it is also a new experience for Mrs.Ma to check homework!
