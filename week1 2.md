## Q&A
ps: this student is poor at history and the answers he answered below only referred to the reading material only. He sincerely apologizes if his responses were contradictive to historical facts.
1. > *How do you think about Bao, who seems to be the one who always sacrifice for Guan?*

   * *Since Bao was relatively wealthy, as result, he might regard money as nothing. Although I can't find out more details through the text given, but i could ensure that Bao was a man of great deeds.*     
<br><br>
2. > *What are the features of a life-long friendship?*
   
   In my humble opinion, the features i conclude as follows:
   *  a positive friendship feature which refers to the one having a greater opportunity to benefit both sides. For instance, two individuals complement each other.
   * Whether two are Compatible: their habits, personality, daily routine and etc will affect the way two make friends. If one's living mode/ communication mode is out pace with another, then there is few chance to maintain a life-long friendship, with copious of tolerance and understanding urgently needed.
   * A Promise is A Promise:  a friendship that extends from birth to grave is set based on the solid foundation of trust. Only with a hundred percent of reliance can two bond together, open their hearts and keep their promise.
  <br><br>
1. > *Could this kind of friendship be nurtured through online communication?*
   
   * I'm afraid not if social media is the only petri dish for friendship, it will ultimately leads to a negative outcome, in the context of the present to be specific. The virtual chat lacking intimacy attachment fill people's basic sentimental needs while with their deep heart vacant. <br><br>
4. > College is a time when you actively seek out new friendships. What kind of relationship do you want to establish with your professors, roommates and classmates? How do social media affect your communication with them?

* I am already a second-year student, indicating i've already experienced and adjusted in campus life. During the first year, I found out that the more I craved for higher GPA at the cost of less social activity, the harder I met my expectation, with disappointment of a chaos term in the end. So I made a change in the second term, the time  signaling the post-covid period, I joined the Fudan baseball association (FBA), where I met a group of mates that both had passion for playing baseball and gained happiness, perspiration and friendship. 
Besides, I became more outgoing and knew more friends, helping me nurture a standard on my ideal friendship: unity, helpful and compatibility. 
For the relationship between students and professors, I hope that it could mutually benefit both sides, academically and personally.
Social media actually gave me a more comfortable way to express my idea and perspectives given that I am a introverted person. Most of the acquaintance is started at social media in the first place, face-to-face meeting afterwards. To conclude, social media literally help me establish potential relationship with others.
